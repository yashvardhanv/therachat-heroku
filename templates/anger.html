      <p>EXPLORING THE ROOTS OF ANGER</p>

      <p>Anger may result in externalizing behaviors. These can include verbal arguments and tantrums. Anger can also
        cause internalizing behaviors. Internalizing behaviors can include sulking or increased symptoms of depression.
        People may show anger through aggression. Aggression is the biological function of anger. It is an evolutionary
        response that helps prepare people to fight off threats.
        Inappropriate displays of anger may mean a more serious mental health or emotional issue exists. People who
        receive anger management therapy learn skills to slow their reaction to anger. This can help them identify the
        reason for their feelings. The roots of anger may be buried in emotional trauma, addiction, grief, or other
        issues. But a natural inclination may be to find temporary relief in lashing out. This can obscure the true
        cause of the anger. If this is the case for you, working with a therapist might be helpful.</p>
      <p>HOW ANGER MANAGEMENT WORKS</p>
      <p>Anger management therapy provides a clear set of recovery guidelines. It gives the person in treatment a
        controlled platform for the release of their emotions. At the same time, it aims to achieve constructive
        responses, rather than destructive ones. People in therapy are encouraged to examine what triggers their anger.
        They try to become aware of their emotions at each level of arousal. People learn how to use those signs as a
        map to control their anger.

        In therapy, people gain insight into how their body responds to past and future events. They do this by
        identifying the emotional reaction to a certain circumstance. Therapists also help people notice anger responses
        that may be defense mechanisms for other concerns. These concerns might be depression, anxiety, or other mental
        health issues.

        Anger management therapy often helps people with anger issues. It may also help the people who make up their
        social network. Uncontrollable anger may lead to harmful psychological and physical conditions. Anger management
        helps to reduce and control anger. This allows people to reduce stress. It can also lower the risk for serious
        health problems. These can include heart disease and high blood pressure.

        The goal of anger management therapy is to teach people how to examine their triggers. It also helps people
        adjust how they look at situations. Successful anger management therapy develops healthy ways for people to
        express anger and frustration. Some techniques used in anger management therapy include:</p>


      <p>Impulse control</p>
      <p>Self-awareness</p>
      <p>Meditation</p>
      <p>Frustration management (sometimes by writing in an anger diary)</p>
      <p>Breathing techniques</p>
      <p>Relaxation strategies</p>
      </p>
      <p>Anger management therapy may take place in one-on-one or group settings. Classes address specific types of
        anger issues. These can include relationship issues, parenting, teens, and work-related anger or rage. Sometimes
        people are court-ordered to attend an anger management class. This can be a result of a domestic or legal issue.

        Therapy is available on a continuing basis. People interested in anger management may also take a retreat or
        online course. Most anger management classes include homework assignments and exercises. These strengthen the
        techniques learned in therapy. They also allow the person in therapy to practice their new skills in real-life
        situations.</p>
