      <p>How To Get Stress Relief with Therapy?</p>
      <p>Stress is a natural part of life. It comes in many forms: emotional, mental, and/or physical. The occasional
        stressors are harmless to our health. In fact, stressors can be utilized to push us to work towards important
        goals, or motivate us out of a bad situation. Moderate levels of stress allow the body and mind to respond at a
        faster speed. However, when the stressor becomes chronic, it can cause significant mental strain and long-term
        health problems.

        “Stress” is defined as a state of mental, emotional strain and/or tension resulting from adverse or very
        demanding circumstances. Though, it’s important to note that stress can develop from within as well. Everyone
        deals with stressful situations at some point in their lives, how we are affected by these stressors, all
        depends on how we learn to deal with them and manage our way through the tough times.</p>
      <p>Causes of Stress</p>
      <p>Being that every person is different, everyone perceives and manifests stress in different ways. However,
        according to surveys, work stress tops the list. Forty percent of U.S. workers admit to experiencing office
        stress, and one-quarter say work is the biggest source of stress in their lives. Though, anything that causes
        discomfort can create stress in our lives. Chronic stress and its symptoms arise when the stressor remains and
        the body doesn’t have the opportunity to repair itself.</p>
      <p>How to Compartmentalize Your Thoughts to Be Less Stressed</p>
      <p>One of the most effective ways of dealing with stress is to compartmentalize. This means learning to set
        boundaries and focus on one thing at a time. Compartmentalizing is when you separate one area of thought from
        another. One way of compartmentalizing is leaving any stress caused by work at work when you hang out with your
        friends. For people with chronic stress, some days can seem so overwhelming that it’s hard to cope with daily
        responsibilities, focus, or think clearly. Everyone experiences these intense feelings of stress from time to
        time and all of us have bad days where stressors make it feel difficult to just make it through the day.

        With the stress of family issues, working, and the pressures of everyday life, many people can feel like they’re
        drowning in a sea of stress. It often feels like there is no escape from the stress and that there is no obvious
        solution for eliminating the stressors that are creating problems for us.

        Therapists and medical professionals agree that in order to maintain health and happiness, individuals must try
        to separate their areas of stress and learn how to use the tool of compartmentalizing. The question becomes how
        to separate everything and do it effectively to reduce your stress levels, which is a process your therapist can
        guide you through. Some of the techniques used for learning to compartmentalize include:</p>
